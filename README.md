# The Useless Web

A school project about creating a 'useless' web page in javascript. This was my first try with the html5 canvas object.

# Installation

Should work on all modern browsers.

# Code Review

1. `classes.js:10-93` - Some class names are a little bit obscure. It would be nice to have a few comments on the classes that summarize what they do.
1. `General` - It wasn't super clear to me what you can do with the circles until I looked at the code. It might be helpful to add a short guide for the user (for example I did not realise I could hold down the mouse button to manipulate the circles. I was only clicking at first).
1. `logic.js:69-121` - This function is hard for me to understand. c1 and c2 are especially confusing to me. Suggestion: Consider perhaps naming things in a more descriptive manner or add a comment.
1. `General` - The site runs perfectly for me in Firefox but I ran in to some lag and issues with rendering the water on Chrome (reloading the window solves the issue when it happens).
1. `index.html:7-7` - Don't forget to update the title :)
